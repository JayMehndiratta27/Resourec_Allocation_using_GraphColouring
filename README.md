#  Resource Allocation Simulator (C++)

This project simulates **resource allocation** among conflicting processes using a graph-based approach similar to register allocation in compilers. It attempts to assign resources to each process while respecting conflict constraints and detects when **spilling** is necessary.

---

##  Features

- Graph-based conflict detection and modeling  
- Simplification phase using conflict count heuristics  
- Safe resource allocation that avoids conflicts  
- Support for multiple allocation attempts with different resource limits  
- Clear and descriptive console output

## How to Build and Run

###  Compile the Code

```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -o resource_alloc resource_alloc.cpp
```

###  Run the Program

```bash
./resource_alloc < input.txt
```

Where `input.txt` contains the formatted input.
